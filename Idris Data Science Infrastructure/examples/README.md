To run the examples in this folder:

- Install all of the libraries mentioned in the talk. (A list of links to all libraries is available at the end of `talk.md`)
- Create a LibreOffice spreadsheet called `Some Data.ods`, with a sheet called `Sheet1`, with a 2 column by 9 row range in the top left. In that range, ensure that the cells in the left column are all string labels, and in the right column are all numbers.
- For the Jupyter Notebook, run Jupyter with this folder as the working directory.
