# Talks

This repository contains the artefacts used in talks I have given.

## Structure

Each talk has its own folder, named after the talk.

Each folder contains a `talk.md`, which contains the information for the slides, and my own notes for use when I give the talk. These `.md` files can be compiled into `.pdf` slides by running `make slides` in the appropriate directory. A `make slides` command at the top level will make the slides for all talks.

Any examples prepared for the talk will be in the `examples` subfolder.
